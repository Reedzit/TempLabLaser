TEST, NULL, NULL, This is just for developement testing. "Under the flickering glow of a busted streetlight in downtown Los Angeles a raccoon named Rico 'The Paw' Mancini ran the city like it was his personal dumpster He wasnt your average trash panda - he was the don of every back alley every food truck corner every overflowing bin from Santa Monica to Silver Lake The humans didnt know his name but they knew his rules\n\nRicos operation was smooth Pigeons ran surveillance from the power lines feral cats handled muscle and the opossums - quiet unassuming - took care of 'waste management' Every restaurant owner in the city paid tribute a leftover burger here a half-eaten taco there You didnt pay? Next morning your kitchen would be crawling with ants and your trash mysteriously torn open\n\nDetective Morales tried to take him down once Set traps baited alleys Rico didnt take kindly to betrayal Morales woke up one morning to find his prized convertible filled - overflowing - with sticky churro wrappers and raccoon paw prints on the leather He transferred to Bakersfield two days later\n\nBy midnight Rico would climb his favorite rooftop overlooking the city From there hed watch the neon lights shimmer off oily puddles the distant hum of freeways echoing below LA was loud chaotic and filthy - just how he liked it Hed lift his tiny paw claws glinting under the moonlight and grin\n\nBecause in this city of angels Rico Mancini was king And every king needs a little trash to sit on his throne"
