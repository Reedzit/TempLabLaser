# TODO (Done): Change the graph to plot:
# Phase of LIA (1) vs Frequency of the laser(2) vs Diffusivity(4)
# Equation thing should output: derivative of: (-(distance between of lasers(user inputed)) * sqrt(pi*freq_laser/diffusivity(what we care about)) = Delta_phase (green vs red))
# X axis: spot distance*sqrt(pi*freq_laser) Spot distance doesn't really change, so this really just a linear product of frequency
# Y axis: Phase of LIA (Lock in amplifier) The phase is going to be changing only as a function of the frequency.
# Find the slope of that graph (Probably the best move here is to estimate it.)
# 1/slope^2 = Diffusivity (what we care about)

# TODO: Priority: 1 add signal verification to automation. It should be able to tell if the amplitude is high enough. It should read about 200 mV

# TODO: Priority: 2 Allow for sensitivity (Gain) changes. Default is 2mV, you will not go over 50mV. The sensitivity should automatically adjust if the amplitude is maxing out.
# The options for this are: 1 2 5 10 20 50 100 200 500 (nV through V for all of those values)

# TODO: HIGHEST PRIORITY: Wait for convergence before taking a measurement.

# TODO: Priority: Implement the laser seperation calculation. The software is called Daheng Galaxy Viewer.
# Information can be found here: https://va-imaging.com/blogs/machine-vision-knowledge-center/daheng-galaxy-viewer-to-program-our-industrial-cameras

# TODO: Priority: 3 Get the CONFIG File to load for the instruments tab.

# TODO: Priority: Find a way to address whether the (green) laser is on or off.

# TODO: Priority: interface the the hexapod into the automation tab. This will be used to move the laser spot around.

# TODO: add uncertainty measurements to the phase and amplitude measurements. Add candlesticks to the graph.
# This will be done by taking 10 measurements after stabilization and then taking the standard deviation of those measurements.

# ISSUE: The phase adjustment is not working properly. But we don't need it.
